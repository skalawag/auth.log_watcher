* Description

Auth.log_watcher watches your auth.log for changes and emails a
notification when watched-for changes are noticed.

* Setup

- You need to install msmtp, create a config file for the root
  account (it runs as root), and chmod it to 600.  Here's an example:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   defaults
   auth             on
   tls              on
   tls_trust_file   /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.crt

   #  gmail address
   account        gmail
   host           smtp.gmail.com
   port           587
   from           YOUREMAIL@gmail.com
   user           YOUREMAIL@gmail.com
   password       YOUR PASSWORD
   tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

   # Set a default account
   account default : gmail
 #+END_EXAMPLE

- You may want to modify the regexes below.

- Since this was designed for Arch Linux for systemd, you should
  modify the variable COMMAND to fit your system.

- The main loop will sleep for 20 seconds. Change that to fit your
  needs. This is not designed to run as a chron job.

- Insert your own email address (or the email address to which you
  want the log info sent).
