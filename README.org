* Description

Auth.log_watcher watches your auth.log for changes and emails a
notification when watched-for changes are noticed.

* Setup

1. You need to install msmtp, create a config file for the root
   account (it runs as root), and chmod it to 600.  Here's an example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
defaults
auth             on
tls              on
tls_trust_file   /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.crt

#  gmail address
account        gmail
host           smtp.gmail.com
port           587
from           YOUREMAIL@gmail.com
user           YOUREMAIL@gmail.com
password       YOUR PASSWORD
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

# Set a default account
account default : gmail
#+END_EXAMPLE

2. You may want to modify the regexes below.

3. Since this was designed for Arch Linux for systemd, you should
   modify auth_path below to point at your auth.log, probably
   /var/log/auth.log. Or just use Arch Linux.

4. The main loop will sleep for 20 seconds. Change that to fit your
   needs. This is not designed to run as a chron job.

5. Insert your own email address (or the email address to which you
   want the log info sent).
